# Stronghold_Finder
Find strongholds in your world by just giving 2 points and 2 angles.
You can compile the code into a jar by compiling the strongholdfinder.class, stronghold$1.class and all the other classes in com/intellij/uiDesigner/core/ with the premade manifest via cmd or download the already compiled jar.
