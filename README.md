# Stronghold_Finder
Find strongholds in your world by just giving 2 points and 2 angles.
You can compile with mvn compile package, package through an ide, or download the pre-compiled jar.

NOTE: When I ran the package function for maven in IntelliJ, It created a jar that worked fine on windows but was slightly broken on mac. I suggest just running 
mvn compile package.
