I plan to convert my program from java swing to javafx soon.
The gui will look a whole lot better and I plan to add an animation when you click the stronghold button.
Right now, I am um, having technical diffuculties so it will probably be a few days before I upload version 2.5 and possibly 3.0.
If you want to help immediately, find a way for me to set up JavaFX version 13.0.2 with JDK 13.0.2 in intellij. Thanks! :)

NOTE: I have downlaoded JDK 13.0.2 and I downloaded JavaFX 13.0.2
I just can't get to work in intellij. I put in the launch arguments and I added everything to my libraries.
It says can't run main class "special". This is very weird because I used intellij's defualt JavaFX template and there are no classes named special.
I tried renaming the main class to special which didn't work.
If you can do anything to help, then please contact me immediately at catakanggames@gmail.com.
If you can't, that is ok. It will just take longer to make and upload since I can't work on it during school(Long story).

Long Story:
During the school year of 2019-2020 before lockdown, I accidentally reset the admin password so I was able to download the latest version of JDK at that time.
That version happened to be 13.0.2. The website where you download JavaFX from only supports the latest version and beta version. I had to literally
go into the internet archive back a year to get access and download JavaFX 13.0.2. So I have it, but I can't get it working. I would download the latest version,
but I don't have admin rights anymore and because of covid, I have the same computer as I did last year. And once the IT guy found out I reset the password he put
a firmware lock on my school mac. Well he never found out actually, he just assumed it was some weird glitch so I dodged a bullet there. So I have 13.0.2 JDK and 
no way to update it. I like to work on my projects during school, but if my project is Fx, I won't be able to do it. If I have to, I will download the latest jdk
on my home computer and work on it there. But like I said, I want to work on it at school. So if anyone can remove the firmware password without creating an admin
account or sending me some sort of file(unless it is free), contact me. I have a MacBook Air 11-Inch, Early 2015. I am going to try to do the hash trick. The one 
where you do a certain keybind to reveal a 33 digit hash on the firmware password screen. I know the last 16 is the password and the first 17 are the serial number
so I am going to try to do that. If someone can help me do that, then thanks!
