I plan to convert my program from java swing to javafx soon.
The gui will look a whole lot better and I plan to add an animation when you click the stronghold button.
Right now, I am um, having technical diffuculties so it will probably be a few days before I upload version 2.5 and possibly 3.0.
If you want to help immediately, find a way for me to set up JavaFX version 13.0.2 with JDK 13.0.2 in intellij. Thanks! :)

UPDATE: I figured it out and now I have javafx working on my school and home computer!
